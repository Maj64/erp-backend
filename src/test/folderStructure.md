Here's a brief description of each folder and file:

__`src/`__: Contains the main source code of the API service.

- __`config/`__: Contains configuration files for the application, such as database configuration, logging, and other environment-specific settings.

- __`controllers/`__: Contains the controller files that handle incoming HTTP requests, delegate tasks to services, and send HTTP responses.
- __`middlewares/`__: Contains middleware functions that process incoming requests before they reach the controllers.
- __`models/`__: Contains the data models, typically for interacting with databases or other data sources.
- __`routes/`__: Contains the route definitions that map different HTTP requests to their respective controllers.
- __`services/`__: Contains the business logic and service files that handle data manipulation and other core operations.
- __`utils/`__: Contains utility functions and modules that are used throughout the application.
- __`index.js`__: The main entry point of the API service that initializes and starts the server.
tests/: Contains the unit and integration tests for the application.

- __`.env`__: Contains the environment-specific variables for the application, such as API keys, database credentials, etc. (Make sure to include .env in your .gitignore file to prevent sensitive data from being exposed in version control.)

- __`.gitignore`__: Specifies the files and folders that should be ignored by Git.

- __`package.json`__: Contains the project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

- __`README.md`__: Provides documentation for the project, including a brief description, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

This folder structure can be easily adapted to various API service requirements and can be further expanded or modified as needed.
